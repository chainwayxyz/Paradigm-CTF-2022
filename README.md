# Paradigm-CTF-2022
[Paradigm CTF](https://ctf.paradigm.xyz/) is a Web3 focused security competition, organized by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/). It's one of the biggest security events in the crypto space, as people interested in smart contract security, we were very excited for this year's event.

We managed to solve seven challenges -got first blood in one- and ranked **42nd** among **446** teams/individuals attending.

This repo includes the original files provided with each challenge along with our solutions inside **"soln/"** in each challenge's directory. Besides the solution scripts, we also wrote README's for each challenge explaining the exploit/solution.
