##  RANDOM Challenge

![XKCD #221](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/random_number.png)

This was probably the easiest challenge in the CTF.

Contrary to its name, _getRandomNumber function always returned 4. So the solution was just as easy as calling the solve function with 4. 

Inside [`soln/`](soln/) a python script we used to send the `solve()` transaction can be found.
