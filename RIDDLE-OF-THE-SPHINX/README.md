##  RIDDLE-OF-THE-SPHINX Challenge

Similar to the RANDOM challenge, this one also didn't require any problem solving other than sending a transaction.

Unfortunately, as people who are used to ethers and web3 library, considering there weren't many resources to consult, interacting with starknet felt like a mini-challenge in itself.

Nevertheless, the answer to the famouse riddle was "man" and the solution was to call the contract function solve with the answer.

In the [`soln/`](soln/) folder, you can see the python script we used to send the solution transaction.
